# Project: findme

"findme" is a web application that provides a modern and efficient way to connect users with information. The project is divided into two main components: the frontend and the backend.

## Frontend
- **Tech Stack**:
  - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for a fast development environment
  - [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/) for building user interfaces
  - [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) for GraphQL communication

## Backend

The backend is powered by Django, GraphQL, Graphene, and PostgreSQL. This robust combination allows for flexible data management and efficient queries, making it an ideal choice for handling the application's data and logic.

- **Tech Stack**:
  
  - [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for web framework
  - [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) for flexible API queries
  - [Graphene](https://graphene-python.org/) for connecting Django and GraphQL
  - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for the database
